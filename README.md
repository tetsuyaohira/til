# Today I Learned (TIL)

## Introduction
This repository serves as a personal archive where I document brief daily learnings in Markdown files. It helps me keep track of even the small things that I might otherwise forget.

## Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to organize and record individual learning snippets. By maintaining this habit, I aim to facilitate information retrieval and reinforce long-term memory retention. This repository might also be useful to others who are looking for concise explanations or examples related to specific technologies or topics.
